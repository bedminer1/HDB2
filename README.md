This is a version 2 of my original HDB Project. The original project was just a basic interface to do query calls on the db and do basic averaging.

With this project, I have ideas of using models for predicting future prices, investigating differences in prices depending on area (Perform a time-based analysis per area to identify faster-growing or declining regions), and doing policy impact analysis.
